                <h2>Social Media Optimization (SMO)</h2>
                
                <p class="researchparagraph">
                Social Media Optimization refers to the utilization of social media as a marketing strategy. By having and operating social media, businesses can add to their profitability through increased advertising, presence, and communication with their client base. Increased visibility by posting on a social media site is a great way for companies to generate business and awareness of their products or services.
                </p>
                
                <p class="researchparagraph">
                The execution of a business’s optimal social media strategy relies on several factors, such as time of day of posting, diction of a post, who actually sees the posting, where it’s posted, and many more. The jobs of social media specialists and managers involve maximizing social media influence, presence, and image through controllable factors. Strategies these professionals use are intended to generate positive opinionation from a target audience, like any advertising. The removal of the barrier between company and clients separates SMO from traditional advertising however, especially due to the current preferred strategy of generating dialogues between corporations and people.
                </p>
                
                <p class="researchparagraph">
                SMO plugins are gaining in popularity as sites incorporate existing social media on their own pages. Website creation suites like Wix and Wordpress have plugins for adding photos from social media sites like Flickr. Embedded social media buttons allow content to be shared from external sites visited by the user. The increased visibility of social media increases visibility of brands, and it is becoming "impossible to separate social media and SEO." Since brands include their social medias on their own sites, the result is a recursive advertisement of the social media and the brand which is promoted on the social media.
